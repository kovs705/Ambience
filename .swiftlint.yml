# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
  - colon
  - comma
  - control_statement
  - type_name
  - identifier_name
  - line_length
  - multiple_closures_with_trailing_closure
  
opt_in_rules: # some rules are turned off by default, so you need to opt-in
  - empty_count # find all the available rules by running: `swiftlint rules`

# Alternatively, specify all rules explicitly by uncommenting this option:
# only_rules: # delete `disabled_rules` & `opt_in_rules` if using this
#   - empty_parameters
#   - vertical_whitespace

analyzer_rules: # rules run by `swiftlint analyze`
  - explicit_self

included: # case-sensitive paths to include during linting. `--path` is ignored if present
  - Ambience
excluded: # case-sensitive paths to ignore during linting. Takes precedence over `included`
  - Carthage
  - Pods
  - Sources/ExcludedFolder
  - Sources/ExcludedFile.swift
  - Sources/*/ExcludedFile.swift # exclude files with a wildcard

# If true, SwiftLint will not fail if no lintable files are found.
allow_zero_lintable_files: false

# configurable rules can be customized from this configuration file
# binary rules can set their severity level
